## 🚀 Overview  

The **Potato Disease Detection System** is a Machine Learning-based project designed to identify **potato leaf diseases** (Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy) using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The system allows farmers to upload leaf images and receive real-time disease predictions, helping in **early detection** and effective disease management.  

## 🎯 Features  

✅ **Deep Learning-based Image Classification** (CNN)  
✅ **Supports Early Blight, Late Blight & Healthy Leaves**  
✅ **User-friendly Web Interface (Streamlit/Flask)**  
✅ **Trained on a Robust Dataset of Potato Leaf Images**  
✅ **Deployment-ready for Web & Mobile Apps**  
✅ **Potential IoT Integration for Real-time Monitoring**  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  

- **Python 3.x**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (CNN Model)  
- **OpenCV** (Image Processing)  
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib** (Data Handling & Visualization)  
- **Flask / Streamlit** (Web Framework)  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** (Model Training)  

## 📂 Dataset  

We used the **dataset**, which contains annotated images of **potato leaf diseases**. It was preprocessed to enhance model accuracy.  

## 🔧 Installation  

1️⃣ Clone this repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PraffulSahu/Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection.git
cd Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection
```  

2️⃣ Install dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

3️⃣ Run the application  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```  
*(or use `flask run` if using Flask for deployment)*  

## 📸 Usage  

1️⃣ **Upload an image** of a potato leaf  
2️⃣ The model analyzes the image using deep learning  
3️⃣ **Get instant results**: Healthy, Early Blight, or Late Blight  
4️⃣ Suggestions for disease control and prevention are provided (future work)
